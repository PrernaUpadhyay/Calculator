# Calculator with ASCII Art ðŸ–©

This is a basic calculator program written in Python, featuring a fun **ASCII art** interface to make it visually appealing. The calculator can handle basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also allows you to continue performing calculations using the result of the previous operation.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **ASCII Art Display**: A calculator design made entirely with ASCII art is displayed upon running the program.
- **Continuous Calculations**: After each calculation, the user has the option to continue calculating with the current result or start a new calculation.

```



4. Follow the prompts in the terminal to enter your numbers and pick operations.

## How It Works

1. **Start the Calculator**: Upon running the program, you will see the ASCII art of the calculator.
2. **Choose Numbers and Operations**: Enter your first number and select an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), followed by a second number.
3. **Continue or Reset**: After showing the result, the program will ask if you want to continue with the current result or start a new calculation.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
What is the first number?: 5
Pick an operation: +
What is the next number?: 10
5.0 + 10.0 = 15.0
Type 'y' to continue calculating with 15.0, or type 'n' to start a new calculation: n
```

## Future Improvements

- Add support for more advanced operations such as exponentiation, square roots, or logarithms.
- Implement error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., division by zero).
